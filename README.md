# KQuickChatComponents

KQuickChatComponents is a library offering various components for QtQuick-based chat apps.

There's mostly nothing yet, so come on by at [our Matrix chat room with KDE NeoChat](https://matrix.to/#/#chatlib:kde.org?via=kde.org&via=opensuse.org&via=matrix.org) or our [Telegram chat with KDE Tok](https://t.me/joinchat/aCp_Uj0vxgZkYmFh) and talk about what we're planning to do.
